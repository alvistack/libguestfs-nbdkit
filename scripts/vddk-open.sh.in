# Open an nbdkit-vddk-plugin connection to the first disk of a guest
# on a VMware ESXi server.  This script automates the tedious bits of
# getting the disk name, moref, etc.  However please read the
# nbdkit-vddk-plugin documentation as well.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vddk-open.sh SERVER GUEST -r -f -v libdir=/path/to/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib [...]
#
# where SERVER is the hostname or IP address of the ESXi server and
# GUEST is the name of the guest.
#
# These two required parameters are followed by any extra nbdkit
# parameters you want to use, such as VDDK libdir, flags, filters etc.
#
# Note that the script runs ./nbdkit (ie. the wrapper in the top build
# directory).
