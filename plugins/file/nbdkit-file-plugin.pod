=head1 NAME

nbdkit-file-plugin - nbdkit file plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit file [file=]FILENAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-file-plugin> is a file serving plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.

It serves the named C<FILENAME> over NBD.  Local block devices
(eg. F</dev/sda>) may also be served.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item [B<file=>]FILENAME

Serve the file named C<FILENAME>.  A local block device name can also
be used here.

This parameter is required.

C<file=> is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.
See L<nbdkit(1)/Magic parameters>.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Files on tmpfs

If you want to expose a file that resides on a file system known to
have poor C<lseek(2)> performance when searching for holes (C<tmpfs>
is known to be one such file system), you can use
L<nbdkit-noextents-filter(1)> to avoid the penalty of probing for
holes.

=head2 Plugin I<--dump-plugin> output

You can obtain extra information about how the file plugin was
compiled by doing:

 nbdkit file --dump-plugin

Some of the fields which may appear are listed below.  Note these are
for information only and may be changed or removed at any time in the
future.

=over 4

=item C<file_blksszget=yes>

=item C<file_blkzeroout=yes>

If both set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of
block devices, where the driver and block device itself supports this.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_punch_hole=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to punch holes (make sparse) files and
block devices.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_zero_range=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of files and
block devices.

=back

=head2 Old C<rdelay> and C<wdelay> parameters.

Before nbdkit supported filters (E<lt> 1.2) this plugin had extra
parameters C<rdelay> and C<wdelay> to insert delays.  These parameters
have been moved to L<nbdkit-delay-filter(1)>.  Modify the command line
to add I<--filter=delay> in order to use these parameters.

=head2 Concatenating files

To concatenate and export multiple files, use
L<nbdkit-split-plugin(1)>.

=head1 DEBUG FLAG

=over 4

=item B<-D file.zero=1>

This enables very verbose debugging of the NBD zero request.  This can
be used to tell if the file plugin is able to zero ranges in the file
or block device efficiently or not.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<$plugindir/nbdkit-file-plugin.so>

Use C<nbdkit --dump-config> to find the location of C<$plugindir>.
